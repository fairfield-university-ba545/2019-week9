    "Learn about Random Forests and build your own model in Python, for both classification and regression.\n",
    "Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm. It can be used both for classification and regression. It is also the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests has a variety of applications, such as recommendation engines, image classification and feature selection. It can be used to classify loyal loan applicants, identify fraudulent activity and predict diseases. It lies at the base of the Boruta algorithm, which selects important features in a dataset.\n",

    "## The Random Forests Algorithm\n",
    "Let’s understand the algorithm in layman’s terms. Suppose you want to go on a trip and you would like to travel to a place which you will enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you do to find a place that you will like? You can search online, read reviews on travel blogs and portals, or you can also ask your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose you have decided to ask your friends, and talked with them about their past travel experience to various places. You will get some recommendations from every friend. Now you have to make a list of those recommended places. Then, you ask them to vote (or select one best place for the trip) from the list of recommended places you made. The place with the highest number of votes will be your final choice for the trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above decision process, there are two parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, asking your friends about their **individual travel experience** and **getting one recommendation** out of multiple places they have visited. This part is like using the decision tree algorithm. Here, each friend makes a selection of the places he or she has visited so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second part, after collecting all the recommendations, is the **voting procedure** for **selecting the best place** in the list of recommendations. This whole process of getting recommendations from friends and voting on them to find the best place is known as the **random forests algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It technically is an **ensemble** method (based on the divide-and-conquer approach) of decision trees generated on a randomly split dataset. This collection of decision tree classifiers is also known as the forest. The individual decision trees are generated using an attribute selection indicator such as **information gain**, **gain ratio**, and **Gini index** for each attribute. Each tree depends on an independent random sample. In a classification problem, each tree votes and the most popular class is chosen as the final result. In the case of regression, the average of all the tree outputs is considered as the final result. It is simpler and more powerful compared to the other non-linear classification algorithms."

    "\n",
    "1. Select random samples from a given dataset.\n",
    "2. Construct a decision tree for each sample and get a prediction result from each decision tree.\n",

    "## Advantages:\n",
    "- Random forests is considered as a highly **accurate** and **robust** method because of the number of decision trees participating in the process.\n",
    "- It does not suffer from the **overfitting** problem. The main reason is that it takes the average of all the predictions, which cancels out the biases.\n",
    "- The algorithm can be used in both **classification** and **regression** problems.\n",
    "- Random forests can also handle **missing values**. There are two ways to handle these: using median values to replace continuous variables, and computing the proximity-weighted average of missing values.\n",
    "- You can get the relative feature importance, which helps in **selecting the most contributing features** for the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Random forests is **slow** in generating predictions because it has multiple decision trees. Whenever it makes a prediction, all the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same given input and then perform voting on it. This whole process is time-consuming.\n",
    "- The model is **difficult to interpret** compared to a decision tree, where you can easily make a decision by following the path in the tree.\n",

    "## Finding important features\n",
    "Random forests also offers a good **feature selection** indicator. `Scikit-learn` provides an extra variable with the model, which shows the relative importance or contribution of each feature in the prediction. It automatically computes the `relevance score` of each feature in the training phase. Then it scales the relevance down so that the sum of all scores is `1`. __Higher relevance score means more important feature__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This score will help you choose the most important features and drop the least important ones for model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest uses `gini importance` or `mean decrease in impurity` (MDI) to calculate the importance of each feature. Gini importance is also known as the total decrease in node impurity. This is how much the model fit or accuracy decreases when you drop a variable. The larger the decrease, the more significant the variable is. Here, the mean decrease is a significant parameter for variable selection. The Gini index can describe the **overall explanatory power** of the variables."
